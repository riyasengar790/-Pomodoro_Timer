# Pomodoro Timer
The Pomodoro Technique, developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s, is based on the concept of breaking work into 25-minute intervals (known as "Pomodoros"), followed by short breaks. This technique aims to enhance focus, manage distractions, and improve overall productivity by leveraging the brain's natural rhythm.

Our Pomodoro Timer application brings this time management method to your desktop, providing a user-friendly interface to help you structure your work sessions effectively.
